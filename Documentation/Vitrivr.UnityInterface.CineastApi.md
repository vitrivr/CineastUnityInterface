# Cineast Unity Interface

Documentation of the Cineast Unity Interface.

## Usage

Use the functions within `CineastWrapper.cs` to send requests to Cineast.

A `cineastapi.json` configuration file conforming to `CineastConfig.cs` must be placed either in the `Assets` directory (when used in the Unity editor) or the persistent data path (depends on platform) in a standalone build.
